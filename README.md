# Project Brief: DJS10 - Asynchrony
# Overview
### Objective
For this project we dived into the asynchronous world of React by creating an application that fetches and displays blog posts from an API. We practiced handling API calls with the Fetch API, managing application state, and gracefully handling errors.

### Project Description
Our task is to build a React application that makes HTTP GET requests to the JSONPlaceholder API to retrieve a list of dummy blog posts. The application should render the titles and bodies of these posts on the screen. We also implemented error handling to manage unsuccessful API calls.


# Project Process


# Challenges
For this project I didn't have any problems, due to the previous other project we worked on which dealt with api fetching and went in depth with using react for different use cases. I would say I struggled to do one thing I had in mind which was having the error message to disappear and the rendering of the data to display when ever the url is fixed without refreshing the page.

# Feedback
This was a great project, but it could have been a bit more in depth to challenge us more.
